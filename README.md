# Groupify
Recommender systems are increasingly used in various domains like movies, travel, music, etc. 
The rise in social activities has increased the usage of recommender systems in general and group 
recommender systems in particular. A group recommender system is a system that recommends 
items to a group of users collectively, given their preferences. In addition to the user preferences, 
using social and behavioural aspects of group members to generate group recommendations will 
increase the quality of the content recommended in heterogeneous groups. Group recommender 
systems also address the cold start problem that arises in an individual recommendation system. 
Many traditional recommender systems have concentrated only on single-user models. But in real 
life, there are many situations, where we interact mostly with groups like watching a movie with 
the family, having dinner with colleagues, planning a vacation with friends, etc. So, group 
recommendation is also an equally important problem to be addressed.
Group recommendation requires three subtasks to be tacked..
1. Acquiring user preference information.
2. Generating recommendations.
3. Helping group members to settle on a final recommendation.
